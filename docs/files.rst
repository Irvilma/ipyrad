ipyrad_ can be used to assemble any kind of data that is generated using a 
restriction digest method (RAD-seq) or

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are increasingly a huge range of ways to generate reduced representation 
genomic data sets using either restriction digestion or a set of primers or baits, 
many of which can be assembled in ipyrad. Because it is difficult to keep up with 
all of the names, we use our own terminology, described below, to group together
data types that can be analyzed using the same methods. If you have a data type
that isn't described below and your're not sure if it can be analyzed in ipyrad
:ref:`let us know here<gitter>`. 

is some confusion in the literature about the names of

RAD

**dd-RAD**
double-digest RAD-seq describes . This includes what double-digest GBS. 

**GBS**
