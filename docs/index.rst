ipyrad: interactive assembly and analysis of RADseq data sets
=============================================================

Welcome to ipyrad, an interactive toolkit for assembly and analysis of 
restriction-site associated genomic data sets (e.g., RAD, ddRAD, GBS) for 
population genetic and phylogenetic studies.

In this documentation you can learn more about what ipyrad does 
(:ref:`features <features>`), and the broader goals behind its design 
(:ref:`ethods <ethos>`). We provide a detailed :ref:`User Guide<userguide>`
to explain exactly how ipyrad works, as well as numerous example 
:ref:`tutorials <tutorials>` to make it easy to get started quickly and
start using ipyrad to assemble and analyze RADseq data sets.
