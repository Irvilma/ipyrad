*ipyrad*: interactive assembly and analysis of RADseq data sets
-------------------------------------------------
Welcome to *ipyrad*, an interactive toolkit for assembly and analysis of 
restriction-site associated genomic data sets (e.g., RAD, ddRAD, GBS) for 
population genetic or phylogenetic studies, with the following goals:

- Provide an easy-to-use and intuitive workflow to convert raw data to formatted output files.
- Offer a range of fast and parallelized assembly methods.
- Create a `reproducible framework`_ for designing complex assembly procedures.
- Allow visualization and checks on the quality of data assemblies. 
- Enable interactive_ access to assembled data and statistics.
