*ipyrad*: interactive assembly and analysis of RADseq data sets
===============================================================

Welcome to *ipyrad*, an interactive toolkit for assembly and analysis of 
restriction-site associated genomic data sets (e.g., RAD, ddRAD, GBS) for 
population genetic or phylogenetic studies, with the following goals:

* Provide an easy-to-use and intuitive workflow to convert raw data to formatted output files.
* Offer a range of fast and parallelized assembly methods.
* Promote a :ref:`reproducible framework <notebooks>` for performing complex assemblies.
* Allow visualization and checks on the quality of data assemblies. 
* Enable :ref:`interactive <interactive>` access to assembled data and statistics.

Read more about the broader goals behind *ipyrad* :ref:`here <ethos>`.
