ipyrad: interactive assembly and analysis of RADseq data sets
=============================================================

Welcome to ipyrad, an interactive toolkit for assembly and analysis of 
restriction-site associated genomic data sets (e.g., RAD, ddRAD, GBS) for 
population genetic and phylogenetic studies.

In this documentation you can learn about the various features of ipyrad 
(:ref:`Features <features>`), the broader motivation behind its design 
(:ref:`Ethos <ethos>`), and access detailed :ref:`Tutorials<userguide>`.
Several new :ref:`Analysis tools <Analysis tools>` are included with ipyrad,
and we are also building a large :ref:`Cookbook` with code for many 
common downstream analyses.
