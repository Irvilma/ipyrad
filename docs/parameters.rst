Assembly Parameters
====================

To assemble data in ipyrad_ a series of 7 functions (steps_) are performed to
sort, filter, cluster, and format the data into output files. Just how these 
different steps function is controlled by a set of parameters that can be 
modified by users. 

The default settings for each parameter are fairly reasonable values for most
assemblies, but you will always need to modify some of them (for example, to 
indicate the location of your data), and often times you will want to modify 
many others as well. The ability to easily assemble your data set under a range
of parameter settings is one of the strengths of ipyrad. 

Below is an explanation of each parameter setting and which steps of the 
assembly it effects.
