Try ipyrad now in the cloud
---------------------------
You can quickly try out ipyrad before installing by connecting to an interactive jupyter notebook running in the cloud `here <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dereneaton/ipyrad/hotfix?filepath=newdocs>`__.

This service only provides access to a single computing core, so ipyrad will obviously run much faster on a larger workstation or server. But this example is sufficient to explore the ipyrad Python API for assembly and data analysis.
