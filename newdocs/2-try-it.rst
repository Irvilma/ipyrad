Run ipyrad in the cloud
------------------------
If you want to quickly try out ipyrad before installing, you can do so easily by connecting to an interactive jupyter notebook running in the cloud. This service only provides access to a single computing core, so obviously ipyrad will run much faster on a larger workstation or server. This example will introduce the ipyrad Python API, which allows you to run ipyrad using Python code. Alternatively, a command-line tool is also available for assembly, as described in the Tutorial section.

Binder
-------
Use `this link <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dereneaton/ipyrad/hotfix?filepath=newdocs>`__ to connect to a tutorial notebook running through a free service called binder to assemble and analyze a small example data set.
